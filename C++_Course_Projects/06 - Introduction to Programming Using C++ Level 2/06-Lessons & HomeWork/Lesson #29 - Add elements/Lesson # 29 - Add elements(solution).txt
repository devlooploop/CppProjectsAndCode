// Course 06 - Introduction to Programming Using C++ Level 2
//  Lesson # 29 - Add elements

/* - Home Work #1
* Write a program to ask the user to enter as many numbers as s/he
* wants, each time a number entered add it to your vector, and ask the user
* if s/he wants to add more numbers until s/he says No, then print all vectors
* elements on the screen.

* Note:
* when you pass a vector as parameter add the "&" so it passes "by Ref" !!
* Make two functions one for read that take vector as it's parameter 
   and 2nd func() for "Print Numbers();"
